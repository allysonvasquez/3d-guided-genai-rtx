# AI Workflow Config Tools for Blender

A Blender add-on that provides JSON-driven workflow actions for camera control, image management, node tree switching, timeline control, and automated image saving. Perfect for AI-assisted video production workflows.

## Features

- **Camera Management**: Automatically switch between cameras and create them if they don't exist
- **Image Editor Control**: Change displayed images in the Image Editor viewport
- **Node Tree Switching**: Switch between different node trees (great for ComfyUI integration)
- **Timeline Control**: Jump to specific frames automatically
- **Image Reset**: Reset images to blank state for new renders
- **Batch Image Saving**: Save multiple images to disk with configurable paths
- **User-Friendly Configuration**: Edit all settings through Blender's preferences UI
- **One-Click Resource Creation**: Create cameras and images directly from the preferences panel
- **Smart Validation**: Visual warnings when resources don't exist, with quick creation buttons
- **JSON Import/Export**: Portable configuration files for sharing workflows

- Supports custom file paths
- Optional overwrite protection

### Configuring Actions

1. Open **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → AI Workflow Config Tools**
2. Use the **+** button to add a new action
3. Select the action in the list to edit its properties
4. Configure the action settings:
   - **Button Name**: Display name in the UI
   - **Action Type**: Choose from Camera Select, Reset, or Save Images
   - **Camera Settings**: Enable/disable camera switching
   - **Image Editor**: Choose which image to display
   - **Node Tree**: Select which node tree to activate
   - **Timeline**: Set frame to jump to
   - **Images**: Add images to reset or save

5. Click **Save to JSON** to persist your configuration

### Creating Cameras and Images

The addon includes smart validation that warns you when a camera or image doesn't exist, and provides quick creation buttons:

#### Creating Cameras

When you specify a camera name that doesn't exist:
1. A **warning icon** appears showing "⚠ Camera 'CameraName' doesn't exist"
2. Click the **+** button next to the camera name field
3. A dialog appears where you can set the camera location (X, Y, Z)
4. Click **OK** to create the camera at that position

[ADD IMAGE: Screenshot showing the Camera settings section with a camera name "Camera.001" typed in, a warning message below saying "⚠ Camera 'Camera.001' doesn't exist", and the + button highlighted next to the search icon]

[ADD IMAGE: Screenshot of the "Create Camera" dialog popup showing fields for X, Y, Z location with the camera name "Camera.001" at the top]

#### Creating Images

When you specify an image name that doesn't exist:
1. A **warning icon** appears showing "⚠ Image 'ImageName' doesn't exist"
2. Click the **+** button next to the image name field
3. A dialog appears where you can set width and height (default: 1920x1080)
4. Click **OK** to create a blank image with those dimensions

This works for:
- **Image Editor View**: The image to display when the action runs
- **Reset Images**: Any images you want to reset to blank
- **Save Images**: Any images you want to save to disk

[ADD IMAGE: Screenshot showing the Image Editor settings section with an image name "FirstFrame" typed in, a warning message below saying "⚠ Image 'FirstFrame' doesn't exist", and the + button highlighted]

#### Validation Features

The preferences panel provides real-time validation:

- **Camera Validation**:
  - Warns if camera doesn't exist
  - Warns if object exists but is not a camera type
  - Shows green checkmark when camera exists and is valid

- **Image Validation**:
  - Warns if image doesn't exist
  - Automatically hidden when image exists

- **Search & Create**:
  - Use the search icon (🔍) to pick from existing resources
  - Use the plus icon (+) to create new resources

[ADD IMAGE: Screenshot showing multiple validation states - one section with a valid camera (no warning), one with a non-existent camera (warning shown), and one with an existing object that's not a camera (different warning shown)]

### Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for setting up a new AI video generation project:

1. **Open Preferences** and click **Edit Config**
2. **Add a new action** called "First Frame Setup"
3. **Configure the action**:
   - Type camera name "Camera.FirstFrame" → Click **+** to create it at position (0, -5, 2)
   - Type image name "FirstFrame" → Click **+** to create it (1920x1080)
   - Enable "Change Image Editor" and select the "FirstFrame" image
   - Enable "Change Node Tree" and select your ComfyUI workflow
4. **Add another action** called "Save Rendered Frames"
   - Select action type: "Save Images"
   - Add image "FirstFrame" → Save as `//output/first_frame.png`
   - Add image "LastFrame" → Save as `//output/last_frame.png`
5. **Save to JSON** to persist your configuration
6. **Switch to 3D View** and click your action buttons to test

### Sharing Configurations

Your configuration is stored in `config.json` in the addon folder. You can:
- Share this file with team members
- Version control it with git
- Create multiple configurations and swap them out
- Edit it directly in a text editor (advanced users)

**Pro Tip**: Use relative paths (`//output/`) instead of absolute paths for portability across different machines and operating systems.

## Configuration File Format

The `config.json` file uses this structure:

```json
[
    {
        "button_name": "First Frame View",
        "action_type": "CAMERA_SELECT",
        "select_camera": true,
        "camera_object_name": "Camera.001",
        "change_image_editor": true,
        "image_name_to_view": "FirstFrame",
        "change_node_tree": true,
        "node_tree_name": "First Frame",
        "update_timeline": false,
        "timeline_frame": 0
    }
]
```

## Development

### Module Structure

The add-on uses a modular architecture:

- **properties.py**: Defines data structures for actions
- **operators.py**: Implements action execution and management
- **panels.py**: Creates the main UI panel in 3D View
- **preferences.py**: Builds the configuration UI in preferences
- **ui_lists.py**: Custom list widgets for actions
- **utils.py**: Shared utility functions
- **config_manager.py**: Handles JSON serialization

### Hot Reload

The add-on supports hot reloading during development. When enabled, changes to modules are automatically reloaded without restarting Blender.

## Troubleshooting

### Actions not appearing
- Click **Reload Config** in the AI Tools panel
- Check the config.json file exists in the addon folder
- Verify the JSON syntax is valid

### Camera/Image not found
- When configuring actions, use the **+** button to create missing cameras or images
- The add-on will also automatically create cameras and images when actions run if they don't exist
- For immediate visibility, create resources via the preferences UI before running actions

### Camera/Image warnings in preferences
- **Warning shown**: Resource doesn't exist - click the **+** button to create it
- **No warning**: Resource exists and is valid
- **"Not a camera" warning**: An object with that name exists but isn't a camera - choose a different name or delete the conflicting object

### Node Tree not found
- Node trees cannot be created automatically - create them in your .blend file first
- Use the ComfyUI Blender addon or manually create node groups
- Ensure the node tree name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

### Config changes not saving
- Make sure you click **Save to JSON** in preferences after editing
- Check file permissions on the config.json file
- Verify the addon folder is writable

### Create buttons not working
- Ensure you've typed a name in the field before clicking the + button
- Check the Blender console (Window → Toggle System Console on Windows) for error messages
- Verify you have permission to create objects in the current scene
